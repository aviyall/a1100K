# a1100K - Radio Frequency Hacking Hub

**a1100K** (a play on words of OOK (On-Off Keying), a simple form of digital signal modulation commonly exploited in RF replay attacks) is a work-in-progress, one-stop shop for all kinds of radio frequency hacks across various platforms. Born from the mind of someone who loves tinkering with both hardware and software, this repository is an evolving collection of tools, scripts, and projects that explore the vulnerabilities of the devices we use in our everyday lives.

One of the key projects in this repo is a **De-Bruijn-empowered radio frequency hacker**, designed to reverse-engineer radio signals from devices like garage door openers, revealing security flaws in common tools around us.

### Current Highlight: De-Bruijn Tool for Arduino & Flipper Zero

This tool is a **Frequency Capturer and De-Bruijn Sequence Generator for Brute-Forcing & Replay Attacks on Cool Platforms** like Arduino and Flipper Zero. It enables frequency analysis, capturing, and brute-forcing through the efficient use of De-Bruijn sequences, perfect for exploring how everyday wireless devices might be compromised.

So far, this tool has been implemented on both the **Flipper Zero** and **Arduino** platforms. Feel free to check it out!
